          <h2>Chandrayaan-2 is slow to reach moon. But it's pure genius</h2>
          <br><h2>One long trip</h2><p>Isro launched Chandrayaan-2 on July 22 and the spacecraft is now headed to the moon where it is expected to soft-land at the lunar south pole on September 7. That's a long 48 days to reach Moon whereas missions launched by USSR and US even over five decades ago reached the lunar surface in under a few days.</p><p>USSR's Luna-2 craft took just 34 hours to reach Moon in 1959. Ten years later on July 20, 1969, Nasa’s Apollo-11 mission carrying humans landed on Moon in just four days, 6 hours and 45 minutes. Besides being the world’s first manned Moon mission, Apollo-11 was also the fastest trip of astronauts to the Moon.</p><br><h2>So why is Chandrayaan-2 taking more than a month?</h2><p>The answer lies in the build of the rocket, the amount of fuel it’s carrying and the speed of the lunarcraft. In space, covering long distances requires high speeds and straight trajectories. For Apollo-11, Nasa had used Saturn V, a super heavy-lift launcher, to travel at more than 39,000km per hour. The powerful rocket had a lifting capability of 43 tonnes, including the lunar module, service module and command module housing the crew capsule.</p><br><h2>It all comes at huge cost</h2><p>Saturn V’s third stage put the modules (command with crew capsule, service and lunar modules) into the trans-lunar trajectory soon after orbiting Earth for the second time. The launcher and the lunar craft used powerful engines to reach Moon covering 3.8 lakh km in just four days. However, Nasa had to pump in $185 million ($1.2 billion in 2016 value) for each Apollo mission between 1969 & 1971. Of the $185 million, it spent $110m ($690m in 2016 value) on every Saturn V.</p><br><h2>Isro's genius</h2><p>India does not have a rocket powerful enough to hurl Chandrayaan-2 on a straight path to Moon. It’s the reason Isro chose a circuitous route to take advantage of Earth’s gravity, which will help slingshot the craft towards the Moon. The role of GSLV-MkIII, with only 4-tonne lifting capability, was limited to putting Chandrayaan-2 (3.8 tonnes) in the geosynchronous transfer orbit. Currently, the lunarcraft’s propulsion system is raising its orbit. Once the craft reaches its apogee (farthest point from Earth), and with added acceleration, the final orbit will become so stretched out that the farthest part will be very close to Moon’s orbit.</p><br><h2>Cheap yet best</h2><p>Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI, "The spacecraft requires a minimum velocity of 11km/ second to go to Moon. Of that, 10.3km/second is provided by the vehicle and 700m/second is being provided by the craft’s propulsion system. Being a small engine, we are burning the engine not continously but in short bursts to manoeuvre the craft. If we had a powerful engine like Saturn V, we could have reached Moon in a single shot." He added, "We are using Moon's gravitational pull to take craft to the lunar orbit. Though we are taking 29 days to reach the lunar orbit, this is the most cost-effective way to travel to Moon.”</p><p>Isro invested Rs 978cr in the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Rs 375cr ($142m) of the total was spent on building GSLVMkIII, a fraction compared to what Nasa had spent on Saturn V.</p>
